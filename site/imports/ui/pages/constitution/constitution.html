                            Utopia started as an idea for an open source, radically transparent, and software powered
                            governence system built using blockchain technology. Although still in its early stages, every
                            aspect of Utopia is being thought up and built by like-minded individuals who aspire to bring
                            possitive change to the world. As the project progresses, the constitution will be drafted and
                            revised using open source contribution principals. It is our hope that this will create a 
                            one-of-kind constitution that truly represents the people. <b>Constitution coming soon!</b>
